###  Fellow Devz âš¡

I'm <code>"Rascode"</code> === Fullstack / Open + Semantic Web / API / Smart Contract / NFT / NoCode...developer. 

### Currently I'm working on:
1. My client-facing branding + marketing consulting site (rascode.io)

3. My personal-brand website that will serve as a roll-up for pretty much everything I am / think / write + do (justinrascoe.com)

I'm looking to collaborate with anyone working in the Web3 space since I beleieve we learn + work best in community.  If that's you, feel free to shoot me a note - github@rascode.dev.
