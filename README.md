### 👋🏽 Fellow Devz - 

My name is "Rascode" and I'm a fullstack / web3 developer. 

Currently I'm working on:
1. My Client facing IT business website
2. My Developer focused website and blog (rascode.dev). + 
3. My personal website that will serve as a roll-up of all my other sites / services.

I'm looking to collaborate with anyone working in the Web3 space since I beleieve we learn + work best in community.  If that's you, feel free to shoot me a note - github@rascode.dev.
